	The project has different unit of sales. Its seen that at the very beginning both of them have more sales and gradually declining. As the project proceeds with declining sales hence the management decides to call for a project withdrawal after 8 years. The beginning balance of WC can be found out from the present balance sheet. The project unit sales price are also found in the IS in sheet 1. The proceeding WC balance is 18.5% of each years sales. Its seen that among the fixed assets, each are depreciatable except of Land which has a final after project value of 1.75 times the current price. The equipment has a salvage value of 25% after the project. The rest of fixed assets have a scrap value worth of 15% of their purchase price. The periodic variable cost is mentioned in sheet 1 of product selling price and fixed cost is 1/15th of fixed liabilities value. The projects WACC is 13%. Based on the above information should the project be proceeded and which one should be proceeded if capital rationing is present?
